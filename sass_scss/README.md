This project is besically to learn about Sass;
Sass has two syntaxes! The SCSS syntax (.scss) is used most commonly. It's a superset of CSS, which means all valid CSS is also valid SCSS. The indented syntax (.sass) is more unusual: it uses indentation rather than curly braces to nest statements, and newlines instead of semicolons to separate them. All our examples are available in both syntaxes.
